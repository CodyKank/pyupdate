#Pyupdate
**Pyupdate** is a small project created to really just mess around with the subprocess module, and was used as practice for making python write to files. Pyupdate is created with python3 and is currently targeted at Debian/Ubuntu systems (apt-get) just because that's what I'm using currently. I plan on adding additional support for other distros in the future. Issues:
* For now, you'll have to make a directory called ".mystuff" in your home directory, as the script doesn't do that for you yet (I'm planning on it).

* The sys-info isn't all too appealing right now. I'm hoping I change that.

* Must be using Debian/Ubuntu (anything with apt-get) for the update process to work.

* Must have python3 installed to use this script (come on, who doesn't have it?)
